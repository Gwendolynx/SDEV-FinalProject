User's Manual

The purpose of this program is to provide the user with quick, simple information on the drug they're researching.
This program utilizes 100 of the top most common drugs and is able to search for both name brand and generic name.
The user is greeted by the application's main window and given a brief instruction on how to proceed. When the 
'Open Drug Input' button is pressed, the search window will open and prompt the user for the drug name. Whether
name brand or generic is entered, information on that drug will be displayed including Generic name, common Brand name,
and a brief drug usage/classification.

The user can then enter another drug or go back to the main window by clicking the 'Restart' button. From there, there is
a close button on the main window to end the program entirely.
